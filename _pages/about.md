## Internship Experience

### AI Image Generation

During my internship from July to August 2023, I focused on leveraging AI technology to generate high-quality and artistically valuable images for modern clothing designs. By utilizing the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion model and implementing fine-tuning techniques, I successfully produced visually stunning clothing pictures. Additionally, I utilized the ControlNet architecture to customize the category and style of the generated clothes, ensuring alignment with client requirements. Here are some of the generated clothes pictures under the theme *ocean and coral reefs*.

To enhance the generation process, I developed a JavaScript script that expanded the functionalities of the existing interface and significantly improved efficiency. On average, it now takes only 13 seconds to generate a fixed style clothes picture with high quality.



## Research Focus

### Image Data Augmentation Algorithm

Currently, I am actively involved in researching image augmentation algorithms. Collaborating with my esteemed tutor [Liupin][liupin@cugb.edu.cn], we are exploring a novel approach to image mixing for data augmentation, building upon the established SnapMix and other mix methods.



## Projects

### Crawlers

One of my notable projects is the development of a Python-based CodeForces Command Line Crawler. This crawler efficiently retrieves ratings and contest information, greatly facilitating my daily training routine.

Additionally, due to the inconvenience of crawling substantial pages of texts, I have written a small script to implement more functions tailored to specific needs.
